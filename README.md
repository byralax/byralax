# Hi, I'm Byron 👋  
**a.k.a. Byralax** — *Code. Secure. Innovate.*

![Byralax Banner](./A_digital_illustration_in_a_futuristic,_cyberpunk_.png)

I'm a **Christian developer** and **cybersecurity explorer**, deeply rooted in code and purpose.  
I build software like I live: secure, clean, and driven by meaning.  
Whether it's spinning up REST APIs, dissecting malware, or crafting sleek UIs, I'm always chasing the next innovation with prayer, caffeine, and terminal tabs open wide.
